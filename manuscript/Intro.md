#Introduction to The Completions Tool

The Completions Tool is used in the construction and commissioning stages of a building, plant or any complex structure, assuring that all components are properly installed, tested, and maintained according to the requirements of the owner and manufacturer.  

This tool allows project managers to ensure appropriate techniques have been used to check, inspect, and test every component (or tag) of the project in an organized manner.  

There are generally 2 handovers and 2 corresponding types of check sheets:  
- Construction to Commissioning ("A" check sheets)
- Commissioning to Operations ("B" check sheets)  
In both cases, handover occurs in groups of systems or sub systems, according to a pre-determined schedule. 

Using The Completions Tool, project managers can record the results of all activities, generate various reports and documents. The tool also keeps track of all deficiencies found. The Completions Tool can show the progress of the project by sub system, system, and as a whole.
