#Add a Tag  

A tag identifies a unique piece of equipment that typically requires a check sheet to ensure (or check) that it has been constructed or installed properly and safely. Tags can range from a single pressure gauge to a steam generator to a cable. To add a check sheet to a tag, refer to [*Add a Check Sheet to a Tag*](#AddCStoTag).

    Tags are organized (scoped) into discrete systems and sub systems for future handover from construction to commissioning, and then from commissioning to operations. 
    
    You can now associate the tag to a **Check Sheet**, **System**, and **Sub System** at this time. This can be changed later. Refer to [*Scope a Tag*](#ScopeTag) for details.
