#Upload or Complete a Check Sheet, Preservation, or Other Progress Document

When check sheets, preservations, or other progress-related documents have been signed off, they can be saved to the project, thus officially "completing" a task (such as a check sheet). Uploading these documents contributes to the progress of the project.
 
1. To complete a check sheet, preservation or other progress document, from the Menu, click **Menu > Progress > Upload**.
